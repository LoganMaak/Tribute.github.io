		<h2>Birth</h2>
		<p class="tribute-info">
			The Sojourner Mars rover was the first wheeled vehicle to travel to another planet, as part of the Mars Pathfinder mission. Sojourner was named after the famous women's rights activist and abolitionisht Sojourner Truth as part of an essay contest held by NASA (won by Valerie Ambroise, a 12-year-old Connecticut resident).
		</p>
		
		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p class="tribute-info">
			The mission began with launch at 6:58 a.m. UTC on December 6th, 1996 and touchdown on Mars on September 27th, 1997. The Pathfinder mission was intended for 7 sols (around 7 Earth days), but far outlasted it's goal, ending after 83 sols (85 Earth days). During this time the Sojourner traveled around 100 meters, outside of which communication would be lost. Communication with Earth was possible throught the Pathfinder base station, transmitting over 500 images of Mars' surface, as well as chemical samples, atmospheric samples and other measuments.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Legacy</h2>
		<p class="tribute-info">
			Earth lost communication with the rover at 3:23 a.m. PDT on September 27th, 1997. This marked the end of the Sojourner mission. Post-mission rover was sent instructions to stay stationary until October 5th, 1997, and then drive around the lander. During the consecutive five months, mission managers tried unsucessfuly to restore full communications, until the inevitable termination of the succesful mission on March 10th, 1998. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter did spot the Pathfinder lander in January, 2007, with possible sightings of the rover up to 6 meters awar. Thus the Sojourner's journey ends, but with updating technology and new ventures toward space hopefully someday this little robot can be recovered.
